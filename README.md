[HTML Forms](https://www.htmlformsplugin.com/#utm_source=github&utm_medium=html-forms&utm_campaign=readme) allows you to add multi-purpose forms to your WordPress site. Your form fields can be defined using regular HTML5 code while the plugin takes care of submitting the form & processing the request.
